    <h1>About LIMA ROBOTICS INDIA</h1>
    <p><strong>LIMA ROBOTICS INDIA</strong> is a student-founded robotics startup focused on designing intelligent, accessible, and purpose-driven machines.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to bring high-impact robotics to life through innovation, simplicity, and affordability. From educational platforms to assistive technologies, we build solutions that move, think, and empower.</p>
    <p><strong>Built from scratch. Backed by vision.</strong><br>This is <strong>LIMA ROBOTICS</strong>.</p>

    <h2>ðŸ§  About the Founder</h2>
    <p>I'm <strong>Sai Dharshan H S</strong>, a Mechatronics student and the founder of LIMA ROBOTICS â€” a student-led robotics startup born from raw passion, deep frustration, and the urge to build things that actually matter.</p>
    <p>I started with just a maze-solving bot. No funding. No lab. No team.<br>But the vision was always bigger â€” a line of intelligent machines built from scratch.</p>
    <p>LIMA ROBOTICS isnâ€™t about hype or status. Itâ€™s about proving that even a single student with enough fire can lead real innovation â€” without waiting for permission.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m not here to show off.<br>Iâ€™m here to show up â€” and build what others only talk about.</p>
