    <h1>About LIMA ROBOTICS INDIA</h1>
    <p><strong>LIMA ROBOTICS INDIA</strong> is a student-founded robotics startup focused on designing intelligent, accessible, and purpose-driven machines.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to bring high-impact robotics to life through innovation, simplicity, and affordability. From educational platforms to assistive technologies, we build solutions that move, think, and empower.</p>
    <p>🛠️ Built from scratch. Backed by vision.<br><strong>This is LIMA ROBOTICS.</strong></p>

    <h2>🧠 About the Founder</h2>
    <p>I'm <strong>Sai Dharshan H S</strong>, a Mechatronics student and the founder of LIMA ROBOTICS — a student-led robotics startup born from raw passion, deep frustration, and the urge to build things that actually matter.</p>
    <p>I started with just a maze-solving bot. No funding. No lab. No team.<br>But the vision was always bigger — a line of intelligent machines built from scratch.</p>
    <p>LIMA ROBOTICS isn’t about hype or status. It’s about proving that even a single student with enough fire can lead real innovation — without waiting for permission.</p>
    <p>I’m not here to show off.<br>I’m here to show up — and build what others only talk about.</p>
